Courtesy of The Lego Group and YouTube.)</em></p>\n<h3>The API security flaws found and reported by API security provider <a href=\"https://salt.security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Salt Security</a> could have allowed for both large-scale account takeover (ATO) attacks on customers&#8217; accounts and server compromise, enabling bad actors to:</h3>\n<ul type=\"disc\">\n<li>\n<h3><em>Manipulate platform users to gain complete control over their accounts.</em></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3><em>Leak personal identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive user data stored internally by the platform.</em></h3>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3><em>Gain access to internal production data, which could have led to a full compromise of the company&#8217;s internal servers.</em></h3>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a href=\"https://salt.security/salt-labs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Salt Labs</a>, the research arm of <a href=\"https://salt.security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Salt Security</a> and a public forum for API security education, discovered discovered both vulnerabilities by examining areas of the site that support user input fields.</h3>\n<h3>In the &#8220;Find Username&#8221; dialog box of the coupon search functionality, researchers found a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that enabled them to inject and execute code on a victim end user&#8217;s machine through a crafted link. The team was able to chain the XSS vulnerability with a Session ID exposed on a different page.</h3>\n<h3>By combining those two vulnerabilities, the researchers could hijack the session and achieve an account takeover (ATO). Bad actors could have used these tactics for full ATO or to steal sensitive user data.</h3>\n<h3>The second vulnerability was found within the platform&#8217;s &#8220;Upload to Wanted List&#8221; page. This endpoint allows users to upload lists of wanted LEGO parts and sets in XML format. Using this feature, Salt Labs researchers could execute an XML External Entity (XXE) injection attack, where an XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser.</h3>\n<h3>By leveraging the XXE injection attack, researchers could read files on the web server and execute a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack that could be abused in many ways – for example, to steal AWS EC2 tokens of the server.</h3>\n<h3>Upon discovering the vulnerabilities, Salt Labs&#8217; researchers followed coordinated disclosure practices with LEGO, and all issues were remediated swiftly.</h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_86424\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-86424\" style=\"width: 403px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https://americansecuritytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yaniv-Balmas-Salt-Security.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-86424\" src=\"https://americansecuritytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yaniv-Balmas-Salt-Security.jpg\" alt=\"Yaniv Balmas, Salt Security VP of Research\" width=\"403\" height=\"304\" srcset=\"https://americansecuritytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yaniv-Balmas-Salt-Security.jpg 700w, https://americansecuritytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yaniv-Balmas-Salt-Security-300x226.jpg 300w, https://americansecuritytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yaniv-Balmas-Salt-Security-80x60.jpg 80w, https://americansecuritytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yaniv-Balmas-Salt-Security-696x525.jpg 696w, https://americansecuritytoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Yaniv-Balmas-Salt-Security-557x420.jpg 557w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 403px) 100vw, 403px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-86424\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yaniv Balmas, Salt Security VP of Research</figcaption></figure>\n<h3><em>&#8220;Today, nearly all business sectors have increased their usage of APIs to enable new functionality and streamline the connection between consumers and vital data and services,&#8221; explained <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaniv-balmas-503493b/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span class=\"xn-person\">Yaniv Balmas</span>, VP of Research, Salt Security</a>. </em></h3>\n<h3><em>&#8220;As a result, APIs have become one of the largest and most significant attack vectors to gain access to company systems and user data.&#8221;</em></h3>\n<h3><em>&#8220;As organizations rapidly scale, many remain unaware of the sheer volume of API security risks and vulnerabilities that exist within their platforms, leaving companies and their valuable data exposed to bad actors.&#8221; </em></h3>\n<h3>According to the recent <a href=\"https://salt.security/api-security-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Salt Security State of API Security Report, Q3 </a><a href=\"https://salt.security/api-security-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">2022</a>, clients of Salt experienced a 117% increase in API attack traffic while their overall API traffic grew 168%.</h3>\n<h3>The<a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3737643-1&amp;h=1614400408&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fc212.net%2Fc%2Flink%2F%3Ft%3D0%26l%3Den%26o%3D3708587-1%26h%3D834614873%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsalt.security%252Fplatform%26a%3DSalt%2BSecurity%2BAPI%2BProtection%2BPlatform&amp;a=%C2%A0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> </a>Salt Security API Protection<a href=\"https://salt.security/platform\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"> Platform</a> enables companies to identify risks and vulnerabilities in APIs before they are exploited by attackers, including those listed in the <a href=\"https://salt.security/blog/owasp-api-security-top-10-explained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">OWASP API Top 10</a>.</h3>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Salt: Securing your innovation\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5nzavnBJj4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><em>(Learn how the Salt Security API Protection Platform helps make it safe to innovate.
